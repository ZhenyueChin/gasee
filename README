GASEE (Genetic Algorithm library for Scientific Exploration and Experiments) is a Java-based library that provides a base structure for genetic algorithm experiments. This library is initially developed as a preparation for further exploratory researches on abstractions of algorithmically important aspects from real biology. For further details on the genesis of this library and its high level architecture, please refer to the paper "Flexible Code Foundation Development For Further Study In Gender-based GA with Recombination Hotspots" attached in the root directory of this project.

Three example implementations are provided in the
